| |java|javascript|
|-|-|-|
|**Execution**|bytecode executed in JVM|script interpreted|
|**Compilation**|source code compiled to byte code (type checking)|sometimes transformed and/or compressed (minimized), but compilation not necessary|
|**Types**|statically typed|dynamically typed|
|**Numeric types**|byte, short, int, long, float, double|Number, BigInt|
|**Portability**|"write once, run anywhere" (still depends on JVM version and implementation)|Was horribly fragmented, today much better thanks to ECMA|
|**OOP**|Everything is OO|possible with prototypes|
|**Inheritance**|OO Class|prototypal|
|**Concurrency**|Thread model|Async callbcks with event loop|
|**First class functions**|"kind of" since java 8|Yes|
|**Function overloading**|Yes|"kind of" with ... rest operator in args|
|**XML + JSON**|XML is a language. XML parsing supported out of the box. JSON OK|JSON is a format (not a language). JSON is a subset of JS (is JS). XML possible via npm.|
|**Exception Handling** (try, catch, finally)|Yes|Yes|
|**Deployment / Scaling**|typically big server, scaled horizontally (add CPU+mem)|typically containerized, scaled vertically (add instances)|
